## Game of life
This is game inspired by Conway's game of life simulator. Click on cells to toggle their state (yellow - live / gray - dead) and watch how your universe lives.

## Live version
[deployed on netlify](https://incandescent-biscotti-7af62b.netlify.app)

## Project setup

### dev

This command compiles dist file. After building you have to serve your dist file. For ubuntu you can run `serve -s dist` to serve it locally.
