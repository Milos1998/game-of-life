## Game of life
This is game inspired by Conway's game of life simulator. Click on cells to toggle their state (yellow - live / gray - dead) and watch how your universe lives.

## Live version
[deployed on netlify](https://incandescent-biscotti-7af62b.netlify.app)

## Project setup
`npm install`

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
`npm run dev`

### Compiles and minifies for production
`npm run build-only`

This command compiles dist file. After building you have to serve your dist file. For ubuntu you can run `serve -s dist` to serve it locally.

## What I learned 
- webpack basics
- pixijs basics
